### What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the development of scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for data-intensive real-time applications.
