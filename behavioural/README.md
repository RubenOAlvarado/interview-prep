# Behavioural Questions

Behavioural questions are designed to assess how you handle various situations, your problem-solving skills, and your ability to work in a team. They have three main purposes:
1. **Assessing Fit**: They help interviewers determine if your values and work style align with the company's culture.
2. **Evaluating Problem-Solving**: They provide insight into how you approach challenges and make decisions.
3. **Understanding Team Dynamics**: They reveal how you interact with others, handle conflict, and contribute to a team environment.

For this companies often relies on the "Tell me about a time when..." format, which encourages you to share specific examples from your past experiences. This method allows you to demonstrate your skills and competencies in real-world scenarios.

## How to prepare for behavioral questions
To prepare for behavioral questions, consider the following steps:
1. **Learn the STAR Method**: The [STAR](star.md) method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured way to answer behavioral questions. It helps you provide clear and concise responses by outlining the context, your role, the actions you took, and the outcomes.
2. **Prepare your answers to common questions**: Reflect on your past experiences and prepare answers to common behavioral questions. Think about situations where you demonstrated leadership, overcame challenges, worked in a team, or handled conflict.
3. **Prepare experiences to showcase fit to the company's culture/core values**: Research the company's culture and core values. Identify experiences that align with these values and be ready to discuss them in your answers.
4. **Try out mock interviews**: Practice answering behavioral questions in a mock interview setting. This will help you become more comfortable with the format and improve your delivery.
5. **Use structured courses/frameworks**: Consider using structured courses or frameworks that focus on behavioral interview preparation. These resources can provide additional guidance and practice opportunities.

Here are some common behavioral questions you might encounter:

- "Why do you want to work here?"
- "Why do you want to leave your current job?"
- "What are you looking at your next role?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a coworker. How did you handle it?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure. How did you manage it?"
- "What project are you most proud of? Why?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had to learn something new quickly. How did you approach it?"
- "Tell about a time when you failed. How did you handle it?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had to adapt to a significant change at work. How did you handle it?"
- "Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?"

## Self introduction
When introducing yourself in a behavioral interview, consider the following topics to cover:
- **Your background**: Briefly share your educational and professional background, highlighting relevant experiences.
- **Your skills and strengths**: Discuss your key skills and strengths that are relevant to the position you're applying for.
- **Your career goals**: Share your short-term and long-term career goals, emphasizing how they align with the company's mission and values.

### Make an elevation pitch
An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you can use to spark interest in yourself or your ideas. It should be concise, engaging, and tailored to your audience. Here's a simple structure to follow:
1. **Introduction**: Start with your name and a brief overview of your professional background.
2. **Value Proposition**: Highlight your key skills, strengths, and what makes you unique. Focus on how these attributes can benefit the company or the role you're applying for.
3. **Call to Action**: End with a statement that encourages further conversation or expresses your enthusiasm for the opportunity.

Remember to highlight your passion and enthusiasm for the role and the company. Practice your elevator pitch to ensure it flows naturally and fits within a 30-60 second timeframe.
