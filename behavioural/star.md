# S.T.A.R framework

The S.T.A.R. framework (situation, task, action, result) is a structured approach to answering behavioral questions. It helps you provide clear and concise responses by outlining the context, your role, the actions you took, and the outcomes. Here's how it works:
1. **Situation**: The interviewer wants you to present a specific situation or challenge you faced. Describe the context and background of the situation, including relevant details that set the stage for your response.
2. **Task**: What were you required to acheive? Explain the specific task or goal you were working towards in that situation. This helps the interviewer understand your role and responsibilities.
3. **Action**: What did you do? Describe the actions you took to address the situation or complete the task. Focus on your specific contributions and decisions, highlighting your skills and problem-solving abilities.
4. **Result**: What was the outcome of your actions? Share the results of your actions, including any measurable achievements or lessons learned. This demonstrates the impact of your efforts and how you contributed to the overall success of the situation.

## Preparing STAR responses
To prepare your S.T.A.R. responses, consider the folowing table, pick up to 3 stories that you can use to answer most of the questions, and then practice them with a friend or in front of a mirror.

| Story | Situation | Task | Action | Result |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1     |           |      |        |        |
| 2     |           |      |        |        |
| 3     |           |      |        |        |

## Example of a S.T.A.R. response
### Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure. How did you manage it?"
**Situation**: In my previous role as a project manager, we had a critical deadline approaching for a major client project. The team was behind schedule due to unexpected technical challenges, and the client was anxious about the delivery.
**Task**: My task was to ensure that we met the deadline while maintaining the quality of the deliverables. I needed to find a way to motivate the team and streamline our processes to catch up.
**Action**: I organized a team meeting to assess the situation and identify bottlenecks. We prioritized tasks, delegated responsibilities, and implemented daily stand-up meetings to track progress. I also communicated transparently with the client, providing regular updates and managing their expectations.
**Result**: As a result, we were able to complete the project on time, and the client was satisfied with the quality of our work. The experience taught me the importance of effective communication and teamwork under pressure, and it strengthened my ability to lead in challenging situations.
