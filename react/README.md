### What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It uses a component-based architecture, enabling the creation of reusable UI components.
React employs a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance, making it efficient for dynamic applications. It supports both client-side and server-side rendering, enhancing SEO capabilities. React's ecosystem includes tools like React Router for routing and Redux for state management, making it a powerful choice for modern web development.
