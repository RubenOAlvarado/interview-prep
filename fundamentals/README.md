# Computer Science Fundamentals

Core concepts and principles that form the foundation of computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and system design. This section is essential for understanding how to solve problems efficiently and effectively in software development.

## Algorithms
I have a separate repository dedicated to algorithms, which you can find [here](https://github.com/RubenOAlvarado/algorithms). Where I put custom implementations of various algorithms in different languages.

## Data Structures
I have a separate repository dedicated to data structures, which you can find [here](https://github.com/RubenOAlvarado/data-structures). Where I put custom implementations of various data structures in different languages.

## Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of time and space. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or memory usage as the input size increases.

## Time Complexity (WIP)
Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is often expressed using Big O notation, which classifies algorithms according to their worst-case or average-case performance.

## Space Complexity (WIP)
Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. It is also expressed using Big O notation and considers both the temporary space allocated by the algorithm and the space required for the input data.

### O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data (n).
Example: Imagine you have a lost of groceries. To find a specific item (like milk), you might need to scan through the entire list. If the list has 5 items, it'll take a relatively short time. But if it has 500 items, it'll take considerably longer, directly proportional to the number of items. This is O(n) time complexity.
